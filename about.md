Hi, I'm Frédéric Bolduc. I'm a game and front-end developer from the arctic wastelands of Quebec. I'm currently looking for work in both of these fields, so feel free to [send me a pigeon](mailto:bolducfrederic@gmail.com) if you want to talk.

This website was made with the awesome [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
