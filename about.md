Hi, I'm Frédéric Bolduc. I'm a game and front-end developer from the arctic wastelands of Quebec. I'm currently working full-time as a UI programmer at [Ubisoft Montreal](https://www.ubisoft.com), as well as a web developer for the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org), but feel free to [send me a pigeon](mailto:bolducfrederic@gmail.com) if you want to talk.

I am also one of the founders of [Terra Arcana](http://terraarcana.com), nothing less than the most awesome LARP event in Quebec.

This website was made with the awesome [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
