      <description>This website! It was made with Jekyll and Hyde, two awesome tools to easily bring together a portfolio website and blog.
It&amp;rsquo;s all open-source and hosted with GitHub Pages, so if you want to take a look at how I did it, head over to GitHub!</description>

      <description>In Déuström, two players take control of gods Sobek and Cthulhu, in an epic battle to determine who will be named the true god of the seas. To do this, they must protect the islands of their followers, while converting those of their enemy (or simply flinging them into the terrifying maelstrom waiting at the center of the ocean!)
Basically, Déuström is a fun two-player party game playable on PC, with a match time of 5 to 10 minutes.</description>

      <description>Graph-VE was a project developed during Google Summer of Code 2015 for the Wikimedia Foundation to bring graph editing capabilities to MediaWiki&amp;rsquo;s VisualEditor project.
With this project, Wikipedia (and all other platforms powered by MediaWiki) editors can now create and edit graphs through the visual editor, bringing more modern behaviours to Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s user experience. This module uses Vega under the hood, a JavaScript library specialized in generating graphs from a JSON-based grammar.</description>

      <description>Zombeat Stromatolite Turbo Party Club is a little rhythm game about zombies, sick beats and disco balls. It was made during the WonderJam, a 48-hour game jam held at UQAC.
The game was made with Unity. I was in charge of the asset integration and UI of the game, including all the menus.</description>
