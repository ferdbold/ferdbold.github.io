I recently did a talk at my university about my experience at Google Summer of Code 2015 with the Wikimedia Foundation. It basically talks about 
the whole process from start to finish, from applying to GSoC to receiving a snazzy t-shirt at the end of the summer. Oh, and how to contribute to 
Wikipedia, since this is what I spent last summer on.

You can find the slides [here]({{ site.base_url }}/slides/google-summer-of-code/) (in French only though, *désolé!*)
