This website! It was made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), two awesome tools to easily bring together a portfolio website and blog.

It's all open-source and hosted with GitHub Pages, so if you want to take a look at how I did it, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/ferdbold/ferdbold.github.io)!
