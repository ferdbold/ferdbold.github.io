**Graph-VE** was a project developed during [Google Summer of Code 2015](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) for the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org) to bring graph editing capabilities to MediaWiki's VisualEditor project.

With this project, Wikipedia (and all other platforms powered by MediaWiki) editors can now create and edit graphs through the visual editor, bringing more modern behaviours to Wikipedia's user experience. This module uses [Vega](http://vega.github.io/) under the hood, a JavaScript library specialized in generating graphs from a JSON-based grammar.

This project eventually led to a 1-year contract with the WMF, where I continued working on Graph-VE, as well as contributing to VisualEditor.
