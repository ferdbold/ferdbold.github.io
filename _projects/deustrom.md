**In Déuström**, two players take control of gods Sobek and Cthulhu, in an epic battle to determine who will be named the true god of the seas. To do this, they must protect the islands of their followers, while converting those of their enemy (or simply flinging them into the terrifying maelstrom waiting at the center of the ocean!)

Basically, Déuström is a fun two-player party game playable on PC, with a match time of 5 to 10 minutes. It was built as an entry for the [2016 Ubisoft Game Lab competition](https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/game-lab-competition/).
Déuström was made with Unity 5 in ten weeks by eight student developers and artists, including me.

Throughout development, I was in charge of leading **UI development**, as well as the **grappling hook/chain mechanic** usable by players.
