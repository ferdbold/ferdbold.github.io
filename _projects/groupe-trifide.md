Groupe Trifide is a company based in Quebec City devoted to bringing cities enterprise-grade geomatic data about their city.

During my time at [Evollia](http://evollia.com), I was the lead developer on the project, which is based on WordPress and Twitter Bootstrap. I was charged with integrating almost all the different pages from mockups, as well as developing all user interactivity within the website.
