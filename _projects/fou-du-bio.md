**[Fou du Bio](http://foudubio.com)** is a small shop in Quebec City that specializes in showcasing natural local products. Their offerings are very diverse: ranging from maple products to prepared foods, with ingredients ranging from all over the province.

I was tasked with integrating the new website for Fou du Bio. This included slicing and producing all the front-end content from static mockups, as well as all HTML/CSS/JS code. I was also tasked with serving the website through WordPress, one of the leading content managers for small businesses.
